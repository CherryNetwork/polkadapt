# PolkADAPT Project Workspace

**Note: If you wish to use PolkADAPT in your application, please follow the installation instructions in the README file of @polkadapt/core (or projects/core/README.md).**

`PolkADAPT is an Augmented Data Application Protocol Technology that aims to be a framework to serve as a data abstraction layer and piping mechanism for applications by providing one single function call namespace and smart data augmentation.

> For example, you can get realtime data from a Kusama RPC node, augmented with indexed data from [Polkascan.io](https://polkascan.io/) and KSM-USD price information from a third party's API using the commands provided by the PolkADAPT system.

## About this repository ##

You're looking at the project workspace and source repository for the @polkadapt NPM packages. This workspace was generated with [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries) to leverage the testing and building tools that come with it.

**Note:** Angular is **not** a dependency of the resulting project libraries. You don't need Angular to use PolkADAPT in your application. The @polkadapt packages are not tied to any application development framework, so you can use this in React, Vue, Angular, etc.

## Installation ##

To use PolkADAPT in your application, follow the installation instructions in the README file of @polkadapt/core (or projects/core/README.md).

If you wish to develop and build the packages yourself, install the workspace development dependencies (`npm install`) and build the libraries with the command `npm run build`. The resulting package files are stored in the `dist` directory.
